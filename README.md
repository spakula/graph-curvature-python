# graph-curvature-python

A script that I used to play with Ollivier-Ricci curvature on graphs.
Approach from https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03033

## un/install

My setup uses [pipenv]. After cloning, run `pipenv install`, which will create a virtual environment (usually under `~/.local/share/virtualenvs`) and installs the required python packages (networkx, numpy, matplotlib, ..).

For cleaning up, `pipenv --rm` will remove the virtual environment from your `~/.local` folder.
